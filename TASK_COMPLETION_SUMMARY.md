- Fixed all pronouns to be consistent (she/her)
- Now aligns perfectly with Sessions 2, 3, and 4

**Changes Made:**
```diff
- Meet **Khaled**, a freshman computer science student at FCAI.
- She just received... he starts coding... he accidentally deletes...
- His friend Ahmed notices him distress...
- Today, you'll follow Khaled's journey as he learns...

+ Meet **Sara**, a freshman computer science student at FCAI.
