# Community Themes

This directory is for community-contributed themes for the portfolio project.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork** the main `Github-Course` repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your theme (e.g., `feature/add-dark-theme`).
3.  Create a new CSS file in this directory (e.g., `dark-theme.css`).
4.  Add your theme styles to the file. Keep it simple!
5.  Submit a Pull Request to the `master` branch of the original `Github-Course` repository.
